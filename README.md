## [[easy] challenge #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/pih8x/easy_challenge_1/)
create a program that will ask the users name, age, and reddit username. have it tell them the information back, in the format:

> your name is (blank), you are (blank) years old, and your username is (blank)

for extra credit, have the program log this information in a file to be accessed later.

## How to build and run
You must have [NASM](https://www.nasm.us/) installed and the binary in your path environment variable.
You must have the Microsoft linker installed.

The easiest way to get a hold of the Microsoft linker is by downloading Microsoft's Visual Studio IDE.

Once these are both reachable via command line, just run the powershell script, and then the executable.
